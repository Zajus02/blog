![Definitely not me](https://blog.zajicek.eu/assets/images/NotMeSmall.jpeg)Personal blog with no aim in particular. Over the past twenty years I have written for various publications about [technology](https://web.archive.org/web/20040607043254/http://www.beinspired.cz/), [computer games](https://web.archive.org/web/20080706124957/http://wolfet.biz/) and [music](https://sicmaggot.cz/author/zajus/). This blog is a place for me to write with no boundaries at all.
